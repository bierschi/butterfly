attacker <- target: target pays ransom
attacker -> target: attacker sends the **SPrivateRSA.pem** file

target -> CPrivate: decrypt the CPrivateRSA.bin\n with **SPrivateRSA.pem**
CPrivate -> target: get the decrypted **CPrivateRSA.pem**
note left: **CPrivateRSA.pem**
target -> AESKeySQL: decrypt the **AESKeySQL.bin** with **CPrivateRSA.pem**
note right: **AESKeySQL.sql**
loop
File <- AESKeySQL: get AESKey/AESIv pair with file hash and filepath
File -> AESKey: decrypt *.bfly file with AESKey
File <- AESKey: get original file
note right: ~*.txt
end
File -> target: target has again access to all decrypted files
