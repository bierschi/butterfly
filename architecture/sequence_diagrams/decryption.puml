attacker <- target: target pays ransom
attacker -> target: attacker sends the **SPrivateRSA.pem** file

target -> CPrivate: decrypt the CPrivateRSA.bin\n with **SPrivateRSA.pem**
CPrivate -> target: get the decrypted **CPrivateRSA.pem**
target -> AESKey: decrypt the AESKey.bin with **CPrivateRSA.pem**
loop
AESKey -> File: decrypt file with AESKey
File -> AESKey: file.txt
end
File -> target: target has again access to all decrypted files
