attacker -> attacker: generate the RSA\n server key pair
attacker -> target: compromise the target host machine

target -> target: generate an infection specific\n client RSA key pair
target -> CPrivate: encrypt the CPrivateRSA.pem with the\n embedded SPublic.pem in the ransomware
CPrivate -> target: save CPrivateRSA.bin on host machine
loop
target -> AESKey: generate for each file a new 128 Bit AESKey
AESKey -> File: encrypt file with 128 Bit AESKey
File -> AESKey: save encrypted File.butterfly
end
AESKey -> CPublic: encrypt AESKey with CPublic.pem
CPublic -> target: save AESKey.bin
target -> target: display ransom note
