autonumber
hnote over SPrivate, SPublic: server rsa key pair (keysize: 13768)
hnote over CPrivate, CPublic: client rsa key pair (keysize: 2048)

attacker -> attacker: generate the RSA\n server key pair
...
attacker -> target: compromise the target host machine
target -> target: generate an infection specific\n client RSA key pair
target -> CPrivate: encrypt the **CPrivateRSA.pem** with the\n embedded **SPublic.pem** in the ransomware
CPrivate -> target: save CPrivateRSA.bin on the host machine
note left: **CPrivateRSA.bin**
loop
target -> AESKey: generate for each file a new 128 Bit AESKey
AESKey -> File: encrypt file with 128 Bit AESKey
File -> AESKey: save encrypted files with butterfly endings
note right: ~*.butterfly
end
AESKey -> CPublic: encrypt AESKey with **CPublic.pem**
CPublic -> target: save AESKey.bin
note left: **AESKey.bin**
target -> target: display ransom note
